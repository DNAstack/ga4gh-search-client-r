This package is used to perform operations against the GA4GH search API, and receive responses in R data frames.

## Usage:
```
library(ga4gh.search)
# URL to a GA4GH search implementation.
baseurl <- "https://localhost/ga4gh_search_implementation"

# list available tables, get the result as a dataframe.
tables <- ga4gh_list_tables(baseurl)

# Execute a query, get the results as a dataframe.
df <- ga4gh_search(baseurl, paste("SELECT * FROM ", tables$name[1], " LIMIT 50"))

```
